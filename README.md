#This repo looks at the basics on Matlab Operations Using Octave,(a less heavy to learn and faster learning and coding curve), CLI and GUI interface that us similar to Matlab in function and usage.

# Installation of Octave
[Install octave from here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download "Octave Homepage")

# Covered Include
- Basic Commands in MATLAB
- Flow Control Statements in MATLAB(if_else while, for 
- Math Functions(Trigonometric, Exponential, Complex, Rounding and remainder, Specialized math functions,Number theoretic functions, Coordinate transforms
- Plots in MATLAB(Basic Plots and Graphs,axis, grid, bar,legending, titleing, xlabel, ylabel, zlabel,xlim, ylim, zlim, stem, subplot, Hold)

In this section we cover the following 
 * Matrix arithmetic operations and array arithmetic operations.  
 * Basic Operations on Electrical, Magnetic and ElectroMagnetc Circuits in Matlab.
 * Transformers circuits 
 * Types of Signals and Operations on them
And more........
