CFD CODES

#### About
In this CFD Codes , we define and derive functions using the following mways;

1. Derivativing the function - Theoretically
2. Finite Difference Method - Forward
3. Finite Difference Method - Backward
4. Finite difference method - Central

Care should be taken by the individual engineer in usage to understand the difference in application of the different methods in analysis.
